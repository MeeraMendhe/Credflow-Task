# Credflow-Task
Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. Find the
minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train is kept
waiting. Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same
day. Arrival and departure time can never be the same for a train but we can have
the arrival time of one train equal to the departure time of the other. At any given
instance of time, the same platform can not be used for both departures of a train
and the arrival of another train. In such cases, we need different platforms.

‚óè Given a matrix of m x n elements, where m is the number of rows and n is the
number of columns. Write a program to return all elements of the matrix in spiral
order.
